Order Book
It is a simple TypeScript-based trading system simulation built with Express.js. It allows users to place market and limit orders for a single ticker ("Google"), matches bids (buy orders) and asks (sell orders), and manages user balances in USD and stock quantities. This project is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating basic order matching and balance management in a trading system.
Features
Place market and limit orders (buy/sell)
Automatic order matching based on price and quantity
View the current order book depth (bids and asks)
Check user balances (USD and stock)
In-memory storage for users, bids, and asks (non-persistent)
Technologies Used
TypeScript: For type-safe JavaScript code
Express.js: Web framework for building the API
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment
body-parser: Middleware for parsing JSON requests
